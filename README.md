# Dinosaurio Imaging Processing (Commuinitydora Edition)-

## Introduction 

Long ago, dinosaurs freely roamed the Earth with their eccentric and unique features. These features ranged from their long necks to help them feast to their sharp claws that allow them to tear through anything in their way. However, now these beautiful beings have been long gone, likely due to a monstrous asteroid that hit the Earth ages ago.

Now, all we have of these beings are their remains and the drawings that people make based on these remains.

For as long as my teammates and I have been conscious, we have all felt strongly about the existence of the dinosaurs, specifically the importance of people having basic knowledge of knowing what specific dinosaurs look like. This interest had first sparked from when our brother, who for privacy and underage purposes will not be named, had incorrectly classified a T-rex as a brontosaurus when we first showed him a picture of a T-rex. We thought this would be the end of it, I mean the difference between a T-rex and brontosaurus are so distinct! That is until he kept making the same mistake, over and over and over again. Alas, we had gotten sick of him getting it wrong so we decided that it would be easier to build him and others alike a model that helps classify dinosaurs.

Therefore, for this project we have created a CNN imaging model that is trained in pictures from a dataset called “Simple Dinosaur Dataset” that we gotten from Kaggle and outputs the prediction of what type of dinosaur the input picture was. This dataset contains a plethora of dinosaur pictures that are labeled with the type of dinosaur they are. These categories consist of Ankylosaurus, Brontosaurus, Pterodactly, T-rex, and Triceratops.

## Cleaning the Data 

First, what we had done to clean the data is to keep only the  images these are that are jpeg, jpg, png to make processing the images easier. We then labled each image with a number ranging between 0-4 where each number corresponds to a specific dinosaur type:

0 - Ankylosaurus

1 - Brontosaurus

2 - Pterodactly

3 - T-rex

4 - triceratops

Afterwards,
